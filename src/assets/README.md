About the example images
========================

The example images are taken from the [clipartsfree.net](http://clipartsfree.net)
site.  According to their start page, the images are "[t]otally free, with no
limit and SVG files".  I suppose that this means that the images are in the
public domain.  However when I added the images (2014-03-09), the site was
being restructured and neither the FAQ nor the terms and conditions of use were
accessible.  So the exact licensing status of the images still needs to be
determined.

TODO: Add a license file for the images!

The PNG images are from [Open Clipart](https://openclipart.org) and in the
public domain.
